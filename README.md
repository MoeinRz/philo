# philosophers project - validated at 100%

This project is a training exercise in multi-threading and multi-processing programming, focusing on the use of mutex and semaphore synchronization mechanisms. It simulates a variation of the well-known Dining Philosophers problem, implementing three different programs with the same basic rules.

# Programs
philo_one: Multi-threaded implementation using mutex for synchronization.
philo_two: Multi-threaded implementation using semaphore for synchronization.
philo_three: Multi-process implementation using semaphore for synchronization.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to explore the challenges of concurrent programming, specifically in scenarios involving shared resources and the need for synchronization. By implementing the Dining Philosophers problem, we learn to efficiently utilize mutex and semaphore mechanisms to ensure the proper execution and survival of the philosophers.

# Optimization
In addition to mastering multi-threading and multi-processing concepts, this project also emphasizes the importance of C optimization. It pushes us to carefully manage CPU usage, striving to minimize overhead and maximize efficiency in order to create a robust and effective solution.

# Getting Started
To run any of the programs, follow the instructions provided in the respective project directories. Each program has its own set of specific requirements and steps for execution. Make sure to read the README file in each program directory for detailed instructions.
